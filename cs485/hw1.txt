1. (5) Consider rigid body transformations in the plane. Draw a right triangle defined by three
points A = (2,1),B = (4,1),C = (4,6).

axis( [ -10, 10, -10, 10 ] );

xs = [ 2, 4, 4 ];
ys = [ 1, 1, 6 ];
fill( x1, y1 );

Consider a rotation matrix T1:

T1 = [ cos(theta) -sin(theta) ; sin(theta) cos(theta) ]

a. What is the determinant of the matrix?

   Answer: cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2*theta)

   The determinant of any 2x2 matrix [ a b; c d ] is ad - bc.


T2 = [ sin(\theta) cos(\theta) ; cos(\theta) -sin(\theta) ]

b. Is the matrix orthonormal?  What is the determinant of the matrix?

   Answer 1. No, because the column 1 vector and column 2 vector are
             not orthogonal unit vectors for all values of theta.
   Answer 2. cos^2(\theta) + sin^2(\theta), which is also 1.

   Notes:
   - Orthonormal matrix implies columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors.
   - The determinant of any 2x2 matrix [ a b ; c d ] is ad - bc.

c. Is T2 rigid body transformation?  What is the difference between T1 and T2,
   how are the results different.

   No.  You can see from drawing the transformed triangle that the red and
   green triangle are rotations using T1, whereas the white and yellow
   triangles seem to be something like a reflection.
