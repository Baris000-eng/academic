I spent some time playing with the quadcopter simulation.

I noticed that the function mdl_quadcopter created a number of
variables in the workspace.  For me, the primary structure to
experiment with looks like it is called 'quad'.  Within quad are
a number of variables that appear to control the simulation.
I was not able to easily locate the way to control the rotor speeds
for the simulation.  I imagine this is defined somewhat deeply
inside the toolkit.

However, I could plot the resulting simulation's X/Y/Z commands
and the rotor speeds.  For some reason, the Z appears to be a
negative number, though it seems consistent otherwise with how
the model appeared during the simulation.

% Commands...

plot(result(:,1),result(:,2:4))

plot(result(:,1),result(:,14:17))
