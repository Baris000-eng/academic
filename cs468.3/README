To run, from the command line enter:

ruby rewrite.rb

Notes:

encrypt.rb – contains the code that will be mutated
encrypt_original.rb – backup, just in case... also useful for comparison
mutator.rb – encrypted mutation code
mutator_original – backup of the mutation code, unencrypted
rewrite.rb – the bootstrap
test.rb – a litmus test you can check between runs, should be affected just like encrypt.rb
test_original.rb – the starting version of test.rb


= Implementation Details:

1. Statement independence evaluation seems pretty solid.
2. Commutativity detection is limited to multiplication.  Addition on string is not commutative, I didn't want to have to rewrite SDES to use a different operation for string concatenation... but this is possible.
3. Junk code is removed and randomly generated each pass.  For ease of human detection, these calls start with the letter j.
4. I had problems early on, but this should be runnable for many many generations without any problems.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

= Dependencies 
Using other libraries is somewhat lame, but it made this approach more... interesting.  I used ruby2ruby, ruby_parser, and sexp_path.
