self modifying ruby

change the source

rearrange statements without dependencies

synonyms

for example:
a = y
b = z

a,b = y,z

b = z
a = y


replace statements with synonyms

mutate(code) => mutated_code

paraphrase(statement, options) # => [semantically_identical_statement]

paraphrase("x = a + b", {:mode=>:more}) # => "x = (a*1)+(b*1)" 

paraphrase(statement, {:mode=>:more})

Mutator.rearrange(statements)


S-expression: an identifier or a list.

List: a sequence consisting of

a left parenthesis,
zero or more S- expressions separated by blanks, and
a right parenthesis.
Thus, the following things are lists (and also S-expressions):

no statement can depend on a subsequent statement

every statement may depend on a previous statement

for all s1 and s2
  connect(s1,s2)
    if dependency(s1,s2)
